## Description

ExVR is a solution for creating and executing 3D/2D experiments using VR or not. Its philosophy is roughly similar to [Psychopy](https://www.psychopy.org/) and can easily be extended by users using scripting (C#, Python) or visual scripting (with nodes).

It is subdivided in two software: 
  *	the designer GUI for creating the experiment content and its randomization
  *	the experiment launcher for that will generate and execute experiments at runtime using Unity3D

They both communicate between themselves and makes easy to operate changes and see immediately the results.
Once the design done, the user can then share the full experiment by exporting it, allowing accurate replications on others computers.

## Origin

The project has been developped at [EPFL LNCO laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lnco/) (Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience) and has been funded by the [EPFL Open Science Fund](https://www.epfl.ch/research/open-science/in-practice/open-science-fund/) from the 2019 cohort. It has been used for dozains of experiments and demos inside LNCO or during external collaborations since its creation in 2018.


## Content

**ExVR** is subdivided in two software:
* **ExVR-designer**: a GUI for creating the experiments and controlling their execution
  * creation
    * experimental flow (routines, loops, interstimulus state)
    * components, configurations and their parameters
    * randomization of the differents loops
    * management of resources (scripts, images, sounds, 3D objects..)
    * actions (association of conditions and components using update/visibility timelines)   
    * scripting using (C#,Python)
    * visual scripting using nodes
    * global settings (display options and others)
    * generation of the differents randomization (using instances files)
    * saving/eport/loading functions
  * execution
    * load current exp (or a subpart) to the launcher
    * load default or specific randomization (using instance files)
    * play/pause/stop/next/previous/goto
    * feedback (exp state, time, routine name, nodes states) from the exp-launcher
    * logs (messages, errors) from the software and the scripts
    * realtime update of components parameters
* **ExVR-exp**: an exp launcher for executing experiments
  * runtime generation for experiments from two xml files generated by the designer:
    * experiment file -> for the content
    * instance file  -> for the randomization

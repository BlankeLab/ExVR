    Python Online ECG QRS Detector based on the Pan-Tomkins algorithm.

    The module is online Python implementation of QRS complex detection in the ECG signal based
    on the Pan-Tomkins algorithm: Pan J, Tompkins W.J., A real-time QRS detection algorithm,
    IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, Vol. BME-32, No. 3, March 1985, pp. 230-236.

    The QRS complex corresponds to the depolarization of the right and left ventricles of the human heart. It is the most visually obvious part of the ECG signal. QRS complex detection is essential for time-domain ECG signal analyses, namely heart rate variability. It makes it possible to compute inter-beat interval (RR interval) values that correspond to the time between two consecutive R peaks. Thus, a QRS complex detector is an ECG-based heart contraction detector.

    Online version detects QRS complexes in a real-time acquired ECG signal. Therefore, it requires an ECG device to be plugged in and receiving a signal in real-time.

    This implementation of a QRS Complex Detector is by no means a certified medical tool and should not be used in health monitoring. It was created and used for experimental purposes in psychophysiology and psychology.

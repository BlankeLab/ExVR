The flow creation panel is the place where you can define the structure of your experiment by placing elements on the arrow.
You have 3 differents available elements:

For adding a new element, first you need to chosse a node:

Then click on the black ball, it will display 3 differents choices:

You can either validate a choice by clicking on the corresponding button or canceling it by clicking anywhere on the grey part.

Here a routine has been created.
The routine is the base container used in experiments, it contains conditions which number depends from its position inside loops. When created outside a loop they only contains a "default" condition.

You can easily move any routine by selecting it:

Then clicking on the right or left arrow:

The cross button can remove any element.


If you create a loop:

You can move either the routine to put it inside, or extending the loop my moving its left or right node to englobe the routine.

You can move a node loop to englobe another one, but loops nodes cannot overlap.

The last option is to create an ISI (Inter Stimulus Interval), they are like an empty routine, but their length is not determined by the loop condiiton.

You can zoom using this bar or adapt the view to the scene by clicking on the button.
